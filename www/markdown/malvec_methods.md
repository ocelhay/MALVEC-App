The protocol consists of four consecutive steps 1) Mosquito collections; 2) Morphological mosquito identification; 3) Susceptibility bioassays; 4) Mosquito storage and transport back to the central laboratories for further analyses.


**1. Mosquito collection**
Ten provinces in Lao PDR and one province in Thailand were selected. Mosquitoes were collected in one village in each of the ten provinces in Lao PDR and in five villages along the Thai/Lao border in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand. Villages were generally divided into quadrants (4 zones) from a central axis to select at random one house per quadrant. The four houses were located at least 30 meters from each other. In each house a village inhabitant collected mosquitoes inside the house and another outside the house from 18:00 to 06:00 during four consecutive nights once. These collections were done in the dry and rainy seasons during 2013-2015. A rotation of collectors between the houses was implemented and coordinated by the supervisors. Each collector signed an informed consent form and received Japanese Encephalitis vaccination. Mosquitoes were collected from the exposed legs of the collectors using glass tubes, stored in individual cups and provided with sugar solution. The number of mosquitoes collected every hour was recorded by supervisors. Buffalo/cow bait collections were carried out by placing a 25m long mosquito net around the animal. Adult mosquitoes landing on the net were collected from 18:00-06:00.

**2. Morphological identification**
The morning following collections, mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species or species group/complex using microscopes and following appropriate identification keys (Rattanarithikul et al. 2006). After identification, mosquitoes were separated by species, kept in separate cages and provided with sugar solution in humid conditions until sufficient numbers were obtained for insecticide resistance bioassays.

**3. Susceptibility bioassays**
Insecticide susceptibility bioassays (tube tests) were performed following WHO protocols to measure the insecticide susceptibility of the different mosquito species collected in Thailand and Lao PDR (WHO 2013). Adult females were exposed to the WHO discriminating dosages of deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%), and DDT (4%). Deltamethrin and permethrin are the main insecticides used for malaria control in Thailand and Lao PDR. Mosquitoes were exposed for 60 min to estimate the knock down time (KDT50 and KDT90). Mortality was recorded 24h after exposure. The recommended number of female mosquitoes needed for each insecticide and each species is 100 females exposed to the insecticide and another 100 females mosquitoes exposed to control papers without insecticide. However, this was not always achieved due to low mosquito density. According to WHO criteria, a mosquito population is considered resistant if the mortality after 24h is below 90%, resistance is suspected when mortality is between 90 and 98% and susceptible when the mortality is over 98%. 

When feasible synergist bioassays were performed in the field to explore the involvement of potential detoxifying enzymes in the phenotype of insecticide resistance. These bioassays were only done on adult female An. hyrcanus s.l. in Thailand, which was found resistant to all insecticides. Two synergists were used, namely 0.25% S.S.S-tributyl phosphotritioate (DEF) an inhibitor of esterases, and 4% pyperonyl butoxide (PBO), an inhibitor of oxidases.

**4. Molecular assays**
After completion of insecticide bioassays, mosquitoes were stored for subsequent identification of sibling species, detection of *Plasmodium* infection and kdr mutations using molecular methods. Mosquitoes surviving bioassays were also stored in RNAlater® solution for subsequent metabolic assays to detect potential metabolic resistance mechanisms (analyses not commenced as per June 2016). 

**5. Sibling species**
Sibling species detection was done using PCR methods as described in Walton et al. (1999), Walton et al. (2007), and Garros et al. (2004) and adapted by our team.

**6. _Plasmodium_ infection**
DNA extracted from the head and thorax of the primary and secondary malaria vectors were used to detect *Plasmodium* infection. DNA extracts of 5 mosquito specimens were pooled and screened by real-time PCR using methods described in Mangold et al. (2005).When a mosquito was found positive, real-time PCR were performed at the individual level to confirm the presence of the parasite. Afterward, a nested PCR method using specific primers allowing detection of five *Plasmodium* species (*P. falciparum*, *P. vivax*, *P. malariae*, *P. ovale* and *P. knowlesi*) was performed. Mosquitoes artificially infected with *Plasmodium* were used as positive controls. 

**7. kdr mutation**
The protocol for kdr detection is described by Syaffrudin et al. (2010). A sample of resistant mosquitoes were sequenced for identification of known resistant mutations (e.g. L1014F).

**8. GIS mapping**
Predictive modelling of spatial distribution of malaria vectors and spatial variation of potential risk of insecticide resistance was done for southern Lao PDR using GIS software (SavGIS) and various environmental and demographic data.
