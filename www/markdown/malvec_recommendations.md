At the final MALVEC stakeholder meeting 21-22 March 2016 in Vientiane, Lao PDR the participants agreed on the following key recommendations based on the results and outputs of the project: 

- Achieve universal coverage and proper use of LLIN for people at risk of malaria according to WHO policy and recommendations.
- Mobilize resources to sustain capacity for insecticide resistance monitoring in Lao PDR as a basis for insecticide resistance management as outlined in Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Monitoring GPIRM (WHO 2012).
- Mobilize resources to sustain capacity for public health entomology and vector control.
- Improve the surveillance and stratification methods by using more cost-effective procedures for mosquito collection.
- Generate complementary data on resistance intensity (and not only the frequency) to measure potential change in the strength of resistance to public health pesticides in malaria vectors.
- In case of IRS implementation consider use of non-pyrethroid insecticides to minimize selection pressure on endophagic/endophilic malaria vectors (combination or mosaic strategy).
- Coordinate action for implementing national registration system for public health insecticides to avoid the use of illegal products for public health pest and vector control.
- Investigate the magnitude of malaria transmission (hidden part of the “iceberg”) in hilly forested areas, rubber plantations, logging camps, etc. by combining entomological, epidemiological, and social surveys.
- Provide populations at high risk of early/outdoor transmission with more effective tools for personal protection.
- Mobilize resources for basic research to fill knowledge gaps in the detection of metabolic resistance (e.g. develop PCR tools for tracking resistance markers).
- Integrate a socio-economical dimension into the fight against malaria as outlined in the Global Malaria Action Plan (RBM 2015).
