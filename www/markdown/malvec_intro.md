A recent national survey in Lao PDR showed that 65% of the Lao population was still living in malaria transmission areas, particularly in the southern part of the country with a predominance of *Plasmodium falciparum* (Jorgensen et al. 2010). In Thailand most people at risk of malaria live close to forested border areas (Corbel et al 2013). The main malaria vectors in mainland Southeast Asia belong to four major species complexes: *Anopheles dirus* s.l. (Dirus complex), *Anopheles minimus* s.l. (Minimus complex), *An. maculatus* s.l. (Maculatus Group), and *Anopheles sundaicus* s.l. (Sundaicus complex). In 2004, an entomological survey in Lao PDR showed that *Anopheles dirus* was an important malaria vector despite low density and that the role of *An. minimus* in the transmission varied over time and space (Trung et al. 2014). However, the successive appearance in tropical forest areas of *An. minimus* during the dry season and *An. dirus* s.s. during the second part of the rainy season allows for sustained transmission of malaria. Additionally, recent environmental modifications linked to agriculture and forestry (e.g. rubber plantations) may change the status of several malaria vectors by providing appropriate ecological conditions (Obsomer et al. 2007). 

Insecticide bioassays showed that *An. minimus* was resistant to pyrethroids in northern Vietnam and Thailand and *An. epiroticus* was resistant to DDT and pyrethroids in Cambodia and southern Vietnam (Van Bortel et al. 2008). It is possible that the use of agricultural insecticides may be the cause for the selection of insecticide resistance and so constituting a danger for the implementation of effective vector control strategies. Unfortunately, there is a general lack of data available on the insecticide resistance of the main malaria vectors in Lao PDR. The “hot-spots” of transmission are located in border areas (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam), with risk of dispersal of the population of vectors and the resistances in the surrounding areas. In Lao PDR, no data are available regarding the impact of agriculture pesticides on resistance selection. The only available means of control of the transmission is the use of pyrethroid treated bed-nets, but in Lao PDR, only 30 to 50% of the people at risk sleep under treated bed-nets (CMPE, 2011). We do not know if the malaria vectors from these areas are endophagic or exophagic. For example, *An. dirus* is known to be exophagic, biting people at twilight at a time of day when people are not protected by nets. Hence, it is necessary to further study the biology of vectors in Lao PDR and Thailand. The risk of insecticide resistance of vectors in South-East Asia represents a potential threat to malaria control. It is urgent to identify the distribution, levels and mechanisms of resistance in malaria vectors in the lower Mekong countries. Such information will assist health authorities to develop prevention and control strategies that are more effective.
