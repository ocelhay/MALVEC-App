**Objectives**

1.	Evaluate bionomics and distribution of malaria vectors, and their role in malaria transmission
2.	Evaluate of distribution, levels and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors.
3.	Evaluate the potential impact of environmental factors on vector dynamics and insecticide resistance selection.
4.	Build capacity in medical entomology in Lao PDR and Thailand.

**Expected outcomes**

-	Set up a comprehensive map representing the “hot spots” for malaria transmission in Lao PDR and Thailand (border area).
-	Generate an insecticide resistance database of the main malaria vectors.
-	Guide public health authorities in the design and implementation of insecticide resistance management strategies.
-	Capacity strengthening of Lao and Thai staff and students in medical entomology and vector control
