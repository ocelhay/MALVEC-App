For a given species and Province/Sub-district, the human and cow biting rates (HBR and CBR) were calculated as follows:

- *HBR = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait / No. of human-nights*,
- *CBR = No. mosquitoes collected on cow bait / No. of cow-nights*,
 
The human biting rates indoors and outdoors were calculated as follows:

- *HBR Indoors = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait indoors / No. of human-nights indoors*,
- *HBR Outdoors = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait outdoors / No. of human-nights outdoors*,
 
The anthropophilic and zoophilic indices were calculated as follows:

- *Anthropophilic Index = HBR / (HBR+CBR)*
- *Zoophilic Index = CBR / (HBR+CBR)*
 
The endophagic and exophagic indices were calculated as follows:
 
- *Endoophagic Index = HBR Indoors / (HBR Indoors + HBR Outdoors)*
- *Exophagic Index = HBR Outdoors / (HBR Indoors + HBR Outdoors)*
