For a given species and Province/Sub-district, 

- *Total Bites Human = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait for all nights (e.g. 2 years collection, 23 nights and 8 collectors in Bokeo)*
- *Total Bites Cow = No. mosquitoes collected on cow bait for all nights*

For a given species and Province/Sub-district, the human and cow biting rates (HBR and CBR) were calculated as follows:

- *HBR = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait / No. of human-nights*,
- *CBR = No. mosquitoes collected on cow bait / No. of cow-nights*,
 
The human biting rates indoors and outdoors were calculated as follows:

- *HBR Indoors = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait indoors / No. of human-nights indoors*,
- *HBR Outdoors = No. mosquitoes collected on human bait outdoors / No. of human-nights outdoors*,
