**Characterization of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand and capacity building in medical entomology.**

This research project was carried out in Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand during 2013-2016 to evaluate the pattern of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Lao PDR and in Thailand (Ubon Ratchathani border province) in order to guide Malaria Control Programme in the design of more effective and sustainable vector control strategies for malaria prevention. The project also studied the abundance, distribution, and ecology of malaria mosquitoes and assessed their role in malaria transmission. Capacity building in medical entomology in Lao PDR and Thailand was carried out.
